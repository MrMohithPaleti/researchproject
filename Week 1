Selected the Gapminder World dataset

After looking through the codebook for the Gapminder dataset, I have decided that I am particularly interested in "Life Expectancy".

I am interested in the association between these two variables: Life Expectancy and Income Per Person.
Hypothesis that I am considering is how long people live and how much money they earn

Added these two variables to my personal codebook: 
lifeexpectancy: 2011 life expectancy at birth (years). The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.
incomeperperson: 2010 Gross Domestic Product per capita in constant 2000 US$. The inflation but not the differences in the cost of living.

Search Terms used on Google Scholar website were: 
global life expectancy income level gapminder

Hence, those are the two variables that I think supplements my research question to continue with the next weeks' lectures.
