Dataset Selection: I have chosen "nesarc_pds" dataset. I also wanted to select gapminder dataset but I chose nesarc_pds as of now. 


Variable Selection: After looking at the codebook of this dataset, I have selected these two variables as my interest to analyze.
1) nicotine dependence
2) smoking


Research Question: 
Are smoking and nicotine dependence associated?
