Dataset Selection: I have chosen "nesarc_pds" dataset. I also wanted to select gapminder dataset but I chose nesarc_pds as of now. 


Variable Selection: After looking at the codebook of this dataset, I have selected these two variables as my interest to analyze.
1) nicotine dependence
2) smoking


Research Question: 
Are smoking and nicotine dependence associated?

Developed Hypothesis: 
Are smoking and nicotine dependence associated among young adults who have smoked in the past 1 year or 12 months? 


Selected the Gapminder World dataset

After looking through the codebook for the Gapminder dataset, I have decided that I am particularly interested in "Life Expectancy".

I am interested in the association between these two variables: Life Expectancy and Income Per Person.

I am interested to analyze how life expentancy is related to income per person using Gapminder dataset.

Added these two variables to my personal codebook: 
lifeexpectancy: 2011 life expectancy at birth (years). The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.
incomeperperson: 2010 Gross Domestic Product per capita in constant 2000 US$. The inflation but not the differences in the cost of living.

Search Terms used on Google Scholar website were: 
global life expectancy income level gapminder

Hence, those are the two variables that I think supplement my research to continue with the next weeks' lectures.
